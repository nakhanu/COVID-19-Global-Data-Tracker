# COVID-19 Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes COVID-19 data with a focus on vaccination progress, case distribution, and trends across countries. The dataset includes global COVID-19 cases and vaccination data, providing insights into how different countries have handled the pandemic.

## Objectives
- Analyze COVID-19 case data to understand global trends.
- Visualize vaccination rollouts and compare vaccination rates across countries.
- Compare COVID-19 case distribution and vaccination rates worldwide.
- Provide insights into anomalies and key patterns in the data.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Python**: Programming language used for data analysis and visualization.
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **matplotlib**: Plotting charts and visualizations.
- **seaborn**: Statistical data visualization.
- **plotly**: Interactive map visualizations.
- **jupyter notebook**: IDE for running and documenting code.
- **Git**: Version control for code management.

## How to Run/View the Project
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed with the necessary libraries (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`).
3. Run the `COVID-19-Global-Data-Tracker.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook to execute the analysis from start to finish.
4. Visualizations will be generated as part of the notebook outputs.

## Insights & Reflections
- This analysis highlights the effectiveness of vaccination programs in controlling the spread of COVID-19, with countries like Israel and Chile showing significant reductions in cases.
- Data anomalies, such as underreporting in some countries, were observed, which warrant further investigation.
- Future work could explore the long-term effects of vaccination and the impact of variants on case trends.
